    "##  Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are working at a company named XYZ. It is looking to launch a new product. For this, the company has prepared a 10-second ad to be showcased on television. Now, your company wants to undertake an ad campaign for this product on television on the three main types of channels, which are news, sports and entertainment. The cost of the ad time is different for each of these channels, and this cost also varies owing to the day of the week, i.e., the cost on weekends is <b>20%</b> more than that on weekdays. The cost/10 seconds of ad time (on weekdays) on these three types of channels is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>News:</b> ₹40,000 <br>\n",
    "<b>Sports:</b> ₹80,000 <br>\n",
    "<b>Entertainment:</b> ₹65,000 <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing budget allotted for this ad campaign is <b>₹10 crores</b>, and the plan to distribute it is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "At least <b>₹2 crores</b> spent on each of the three types of channels <br>\n",
    "At least <b>₹2.5 crores</b> spent during the weekdays  <br>\n",
    "At least <b>₹4 crores</b> spent during the weekends  <br>\n",
    "At least <b>₹50 lakh spent/type of channel/type of day</b>, i.e., at least ₹50 lakh should be spent on every type of channel and on every type of the day, i.e., both weekdays and weekends. For example, the money spent on the ad time, say, news channels on weekdays, should be at least ₹50 lakh. Similarly, the money spent on entertainment channels on weekends should be at least ₹50 lakh.\\\n",
    "So, using the budget allocated and all the above-mentioned constraints, you want to maximise the number of times for which the ad is shown on TV. Formulate your constraints in Excel, find the optimal solution and answer the questions given below.\n"
